	<h1>Chicken</h1>

	<p>
		The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild
		species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or
		cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been
		castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
	</p>

	<p>
		Originally raised for cockfighting during the 500 B.C time frame in China according to estimations in the study
		of the sub-haplogroup C1,[2] or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic
		period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).[3][4] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both
		their meat and eggs) and as pets.
